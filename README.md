# Dimension_reduction

This repository is aimed to deepen my knowledge about dimension reduction technique. The reference notebook is used to follow other's coding.

After that, another data set will be used. It aims to use the technique I have learnt and apply it on the data set.

### Progress:
1) PCA_learning_reference.ipynb
- Finished following the code from the reference (10/02/2022)
- Up-coming target: apply the PCA components to other data set (such as house price) and check with the improvement

2) Note_Dimension_reduction.ipynb
- Finished the comparison of t-SNE & UMAP (08/02/2022)
- Up-comint target: try to investigate other model listed in the beginning of note book (Part 2)
